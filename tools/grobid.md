  Data.


  GROBID is a machine learning library for extracting, parsing and re-structuring
  raw documents such as PDF into structured XML/TEI encoded documents with a particular
  focus on technical and scientific publications.


  GROBID should run properly "out of the box" on Linux (32 and 64 bits) and macOS. '
