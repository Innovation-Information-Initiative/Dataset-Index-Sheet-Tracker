  -- a bibliographical reference matching service: from an input such as a raw bibliographical
  reference and/or a combination of key metadata, the service will return the disambiguated
  bibliographical object with in particular its DOI and a set of metadata aggregated
  from Crossref and other sources,

  --  a fast metadata look-up service: from a "strong" identifier such as DOI, PMID,
  etc. the service will return a set of metadata aggregated from Crossref and other
  sources,

  --  various mapping between DOI, PMID, PMC, ISTEX ID and ark, integrated in the
  bibliographical service,

  --  Open Access resolver: Integration of Open Access links via the Unpaywall dataset
  from Impactstory,

  --  Gap and daily update for Crossref resources (via the Crossref REST API), so
  that your glutton data service stays always in sync with Crossref,

  --  MeSH classes mapping for PubMed articles.'
