description: The EPO and USPTO both had highly developed patent classification systems,
  the European CLAssification (ECLA) and the United States Patent Classification (USPC)
  respectively. CPC is the outcome of an ambitious harmonization effort to bring the
  best practices from each Office together. In fact, most U.S. patent documents are
  already classified in ECLA. The conversion from ECLA to CPC at the EPO will ensure
  IPC compliance and eliminate the need for the EPO to classify U.S. patent documents.
  At the USPTO, the conversion will provide an up-to date classification system that
  is internationally compatible.
