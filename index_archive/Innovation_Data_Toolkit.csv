23999351-4c68-4e28-aec2-9b16e18e4d9c,Automated Patent Landscaping,patent_landscaping,https://github.com/google/patents-public-data/tree/master/models/landscaping,"Patent landscaping is the process of finding patents related to a particular topic. It is important for companies, investors, governments, and academics seeking to gauge innovation and assess risk. However, there is no broadly recognized best approach to landscaping. Frequently, patent landscaping is a bespoke human-driven process that relies heavily on complex queries over bibliographic patent databases. This tool can be used to perform Automated Patent Landscaping, an approach that jointly leverages human domain expertise, heuristics based on patent metadata, and machine learning to generate high-quality patent landscapes with minimal effort.",https://github.com/google/patents-public-data/tree/master/models/landscaping,"Google Patents, Aaron Abood, Dave Feltenberger",,http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0,"machine learning, patent landscaping, citation",,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10506-018-9222-4.pdf

To do this, you'd need to be able to join your list of patent publication numbers with a dataset containing the patent text. Additionally, you'd need a method to extract the first claim from the rest of the claims. This notebook is a demonstration of one method to perform this analysis using python, BigQuery, and Google's new public dataset on patents.",,"Google Patents, Otto Stegmaier, MtDersvan",,http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0,machine learning

While our approach may be an improvement over simpler methods, it is still imperfect and does not account for any semantic meaning within the text of the claim. This is not intended to be a recommendation on how to measure claim breadth, but instead we aim to spark academic and corporate interest in using the large amounts of public patent data in BigQuery to further the state of the art in patent research.",https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/measuring-patent-claim-breadth-using-google-patents-public-datasets,"Google Patents, Otto Stegmaier, Vihang Mehta, Darío Hereñú",,http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0,machine learning

This package contains functions to automate the process of forward and backward citation chasing by making use of the Lens.org API. An input article list can be used to return a list of all referenced records, and/or all citing records in the Lens.org database (consisting of PubMed, PubMed Central, CrossRef, Microsoft Academic Graph and CORE; 'https://www.lens.org').",,Neal Haddaway,"Haddaway, N.R., Grainger, M.J., Gray, C.T. 2021. citationchaser: An R package and Shiny app for forward and backward citations chasing in academic searching.",MIT License,"citation, reviews, lens",,,,"Wed, 01 Dec 2021 19:24:38 GMT"

It facilitates a systematic review of a knowledge domain through an in-depth visual analytic process.
