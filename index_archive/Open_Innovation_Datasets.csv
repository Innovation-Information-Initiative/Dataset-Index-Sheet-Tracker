One key contribution of the data construction work was to harmonize applicant names and uniquely identify applicants for all four forms of IP. 

This database enabled the research work on the incidence and consequences of trademark squatting in Chile as well as on pharmaceutical patents in Chile, which also took place during the project’s first phase (CDIP/14/INF/3 and CDIP/15/INF/2, respectively). Another output of the first phase project was the matching of the data on IP use to firm-level data of the National Statistical Institute (INE) – specifically, the manufacturing census (ENIA) as well as five waves (1997-2008) of the Chilean innovation survey (INNOVACION).

Our measure counts the number of words in the patents’ first claim. The longer the first claim, the less scope a patent has. This is because a longer claim has more details – and all those details must be met for another invention to be infringing. Hence, the more details there are in the patent, the greater are the opportunities for others to invent around it. We validate our measure by showing both that patent attorneys’ subjective assessments of scope agree with our estimates, and that the behavior of patenters is consistent with it.

Our data imputation method exploits detailed institutional knowledge about the international patent system, and we codify it in a SQL algorithm.

Dedicated data gathering started from March 11th yielding over 4 million tweets a day.

The data collected from the stream captures all languages, but the higher prevalence are: English, Spanish, and French. We release all tweets and retweets on the full dataset, and a cleaned version with no retweets. There are several practical reasons for us to leave the retweets, tracing important tweets and their dissemination is one of them. For NLP tasks we provide the top 1000 frequent terms, the top 1000 bigrams, and the top 1000 trigrams. Some general statistics per day are included for both datasets.",,"
