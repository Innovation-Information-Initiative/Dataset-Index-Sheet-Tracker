Our measure counts the number of words in the patents’ first claim. The longer the first claim, the less scope a patent has. This is because a longer claim has more details – and all those details must be met for another invention to be infringing. Hence, the more details there are in the patent, the greater are the opportunities for others to invent around it. We validate our measure by showing both that patent attorneys’ subjective assessments of scope agree with our estimates, and that the behavior of patenters is consistent with it. To facilitate drawing causal inferences with our measure, we show how it can be used to create an instrumental variable, patent examiner Scope Toughness, which we also validate.",These datasets are provided to the public  subject to the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives license.

The first 9 weeks of data (from January 1st, 2020 to March 11th, 2020) contain very low tweet counts as we filtered other data we were collecting for other research purposes, however, one can see the dramatic increase as the awareness for the virus spread. Dedicated data gathering started from March 11th yielding over 4 million tweets a day.

The data collected from the stream captures all languages, but the higher prevalence are: English, Spanish, and French. We release all tweets and retweets on the full dataset, and a cleaned version with no retweets. There are several practical reasons for us to leave the retweets, tracing important tweets and their dissemination is one of them. For NLP tasks we provide the top 1000 frequent terms, the top 1000 bigrams, and the top 1000 trigrams. Some general statistics per day are included for both datasets.", ,Jan 2020-present,http://www.panacealab.org/covid19/,,"

        abstract = {Version 78 of the dataset. The peer-reviewed publication for this dataset has now been published  in Epidemiologia an MDPI journal, and can be accessed here: https://doi.org/10.3390/epidemiologia2030024. Please cite this when using the dataset. Due to the relevance of the COVID-19 global pandemic, we are releasing our dataset of tweets acquired from the Twitter Stream related to COVID-19 chatter. Since our first release we have received additional data from our new collaborators, allowing this resource to grow to its current size. Dedicated data gathering started from March 11th yielding over 4 million tweets a day. We have added additional data provided by our new collaborators from January 27th to March 27th, to provide extra longitudinal coverage. Version 10 added {\textasciitilde}1.5 million tweets in the Russian language collected between January 1st and May 8th, gracefully provided to us by: Katya Artemova (NRU HSE) and Elena Tutubalina (KFU). From version 12 we have included daily hashtags, mentions and emoijis and their frequencies the respective zip files. From version 14 we have included the tweet identifiers and their respective language for the clean version of the dataset. Since version 20 we have included language and place location for all tweets. The data collected from the stream captures all languages, but the higher prevalence are:  English, Spanish, and French. We release all tweets and retweets on the full\_dataset.tsv file (1,198,902,806 unique tweets), and a cleaned version with no retweets on the full\_dataset-clean.tsv file (306,791,449 unique tweets). There are several practical reasons for us to leave the retweets, tracing important tweets and their dissemination is one of them. For NLP tasks we provide the top 1000 frequent terms in frequent\_terms.csv, the top 1000 bigrams in frequent\_bigrams.csv, and the top 1000 trigrams in frequent\_trigrams.csv. Some general statistics per day are included for both datasets in the full\_dataset-statistics.tsv and full\_dataset-clean-statistics.tsv files. For more statistics and some visualizations visit: http://www.panacealab.org/covid19/  More details can be found (and will be updated faster at: https://github.com/thepanacealab/covid19\_twitter) and our pre-print about the dataset (https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03688)  As always, the tweets distributed here are only tweet identifiers (with date and time added) due to the terms and conditions of Twitter to re-distribute Twitter data ONLY for research purposes.
