Our measure counts the number of words in the patents’ first claim. The longer the first claim, the less scope a patent has. This is because a longer claim has more details – and all those details must be met for another invention to be infringing. Hence, the more details there are in the patent, the greater are the opportunities for others to invent around it. We validate our measure by showing both that patent attorneys’ subjective assessments of scope agree with our estimates, and that the behavior of patenters is consistent with it.

However, publicly available citations data is often misleading, for instance by attributing a patent citation to the patent examiner when it was in fact first submitted by the patent application. This dataset uses internal USPTO data to identify the date on which each citation was first submitted as well as the party (examiner or applicant) who first submitted it. The dataset includes observations for citations made by patents issued 2001-2014, although some level of leftward truncation is evident due to limitations in internal data availability at the USPTO.",These datasets are provided to the public  subject to the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives license.
