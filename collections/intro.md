title: Essential Patent Analysis Datasets
---

The following datasets provide a great start point for analysis of innovation data:

* patent data and disambiguation
	* [PatentsView](/datasets/patcit)
	* [PATSTAT](/datasets/patstat) (NB: not an open dataset)
	* [Google Patents Public Datasets](/datasets/google_patents_public)
* patent citation to literature
	* [Lens.org](/datasets/lens)
	* [Patcit](/datasets/patcit)
	* [Reliance on Science](/datasets/rons)
* matching patents to firms
	* [DISCERN Patent Compustat Crosswalk](/datasets/discern)
	* [Chinese Patent Data Project](/datasets/chinese_patent_data)

## Guides

* [WIPO Manual on Open Source Patent Analytics](https://wipo-analytics.github.io/) and accompanying [Github Repository](https://github.com/wipo-analytics), which gives a practical guide to free and open source software tools for patent analytics
* [Lens Labs Knowledge Database](https://support.lens.org/knowledge-database/), which contains extensive information about patent analysis, including legal status calculation, geographical variability in patent law, analysis of biological patents and guides to reading patents
* Paul Oldham's guide [Understanding Patent Data Fields](https://www.pauloldham.net/patent-data-fields/), which gives a thorough overview of using patent identifiers, and also features in the WIPO manual
