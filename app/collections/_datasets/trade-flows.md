  = {There is a newer version of this database - please check the right-hand navigation
  for the latest version. We update the change log, versioning and other information
  on a Google Doc that is updated and continuous between posted versions of this database. We
  have included a snapshot of the documentation file here to help with future use
  along with an Excel version of the file for non-STATA users. This document also
  includes information on submitting edits and corrections to the open source data,
  which we welcome and encourage. We will acknowledge the participation of editors
  in the versioning changes at the bottom of the Google Doc.  This revision includes
  potentially relevant 8k filings from 270 days before and after the CEO's departure
  date. These filings were not all useful for understanding the departure, but might
  be useful in general.   If you would like to get an email notification when we update
  the database, sign-up here. We're happy to let you know when it is updated.},\n\turldate
