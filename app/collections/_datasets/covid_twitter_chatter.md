description: 'Dataset of tweets acquired from the Twitter Stream related to COVID-19
  chatter. The first 9 weeks of data (from January 1st, 2020 to March 11th, 2020)
  contain very low tweet counts as we filtered other data we were collecting for other
  research purposes, however, one can see the dramatic increase as the awareness for
  the virus spread. Dedicated data gathering started from March 11th yielding over
  4 million tweets a day. The data collected from the stream captures all languages, but the higher prevalence
  are: English, Spanish, and French. We release all tweets and retweets on the full
  dataset, and a cleaned version with no retweets. There are several practical reasons
  for us to leave the retweets, tracing important tweets and their dissemination is
  one of them. For NLP tasks we provide the top 1000 frequent terms, the top 1000
  bigrams, and the top 1000 trigrams. Some general statistics per day are included
  for both datasets.'
