description: 'Patents (as well as scientific articles, and NPL citations at the aggregate
  firm-level) matched to U.S. Compustat firms over the period 1980-2015. In extending
  the match to Compustat up to 2015, we address two major challenges: name changes
  and ownership changes. Our UO and subsidiary historical standardized firm name lists,
  including the dynamic reassignment, are publicly available for researches to match
  to their database of interest.'
