Collections are a way to list resources around a theme, relevant to a research agenda or set of papers, or as an introduction to various aspects of the field. They are formatted in markdown:

To list a dataset that's in the index, use a relative link, e.g.

```markdown
[local dataset name](/datasets/dataset_shortname)
```

Dataset shortnames can be found either by looking at the urls directly, or through the 'shortnames' column of the [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bdyhGrj0oNz-_qW3Rv2GNGqhZZ73rgj-DYWePLA_1Ms/edit#gid=1389884911).
