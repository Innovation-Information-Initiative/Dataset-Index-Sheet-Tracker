description: The Patent Claims Research Dataset contain detailed information on claims
  from U.S. patents granted between 1976 and 2014 and U.S. patent applications published
  between 2001 and 2014. The dataset is derived from the Patent Application Publication
  Full-Text and Patent Grant Full Text files, available at https://bulkdata.uspto.gov/,
  to which the Office of Chief Economist (OCE) applied a Python algorithm to identify
  individual claims as well as the dependency relationship between claims. From the
  parsed claims text, OCE created six data files containing individually-parsed claims,
  claim-level statistics, and document-level statistics, including newly-developed
  measures of patent scope.
