description: '“RETech” measures whether the patent pertains to a technological area
  that is rapidly evolving (i.e., following breakthroughs) or stable. Higher levels
  of the measure detects patents in new areas and those in subsequent waves of development.
  High RETech patents substitute for existing technologies rather than complement
  them, receive more citations and get higher stock market reactions. Among measures
  without look-ahead bias, RETech has the strongest association with notable breakthrough
  patents (like lasers, DNA modifications,  satellites, Google’s PageRank, and more).


  “Tech Breadth” measures how much (or little) the patent’s text is spread across
  technological fields. Patents with low levels of breadth (i.e. 0) are niche and
  can be understood by scientists familiar with a single field of study. High values
  of breadth indicate that the patent imbues ideas from many fields and will likely
  require teams with diverse knowledge to implement. Low breadth patents should be
  more redeployable and complementary to the technology stacks outside the inventing
  firm.                       '
