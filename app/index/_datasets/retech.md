description: "“RETech” measures whether the patent pertains to a technological area
  that is rapidly evolving (i.e., following breakthroughs) or stable. Higher levels
  of our measure detects patents in new areas and those in subsequent waves of development.
  High RETech patents substitute for existing technologies rather than complement
  them, receive more citations and get higher stock market reactions. Among measures
  without look-ahead bias, RETech has the strongest association with notable breakthrough
  patents (like lasers, DNA modifications,  satellites, Google’s PageRank, and more).\n\n“Tech
  Breadth” measures how much (or little) the patent’s text is spread \nacross technological
  fields. Patents with low levels of breadth (i.e. 0) are niche and can be understood
  by scientists familiar with a single field of study. High values of breadth indicate
  that the patent imbues ideas from many fields and will likely require teams with
  diverse knowledge to implement. As such, we expect low breadth patents to be more
  redeployable and complementary to the technology stacks outside the inventing firm.
