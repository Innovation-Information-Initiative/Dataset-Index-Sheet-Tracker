description: 'We propose a new measure of the economic importance of each innovation.
  Our measure uses newly collected data on patents issued to U.S. firms in the 1926
  to 2010 period, combined with the stock market response to news about patents. Our
  patent-level estimates of private economic value are positively related to the scientific
  value of these patents, as measured by the number of citations the patent receives
  in the future. Our new measure is associated with substantial growth, reallocation,
  and creative destruction, consistent with the predictions of Schumpeterian growth
  models. Aggregating our measure suggests that technological innovation accounts
  for significant medium-run fluctuations in aggregate economic growth and TFP. Our
  measure contains additional information relative to citation-weighted patent counts;
  the relation between our measure and firm growth is considerably stronger. Importantly,
  the degree of creative destruction that is associated with our measure is higher
  than previous estimates, confirming that it is a useful proxy for the private valuation
  of patents.


  This data provides an updated data series for KPSS values and forward citations,
  a patent number to the CRSP "permno" match and a patent number to CPC class match
