description: The Artificial Intelligence Patent Dataset consists of two files, both
  released by the OCE. The first data file identifies United States (U.S.) patents
  issued between 1976 and 2020 and pre-grant publications (PGPubs) published through
  2020 that contain one or more of several AI technology components (including machine
  learning, natural language processing, computer vision, speech, knowledge processing,
  AI hardware, evolutionary computation, and planning and control). OCE generated
  this data file using a machine learning (ML) approach that analyzed patent text
  and citations to identify AI in U.S. patent documents. he second data file contains
  the patent documents used to train the ML models.
