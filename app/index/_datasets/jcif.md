description: This measure is analogous to the commonly used Journal Impact Factor
  (JIF), which is also calculated here. A journalâ€™s impact factor is a popular measure
  of its quality, calculated for year t as the number of times articles from years
  t-1 and t-2 were cited during year t, divided by the number of articles published
  during years t-1 and t-2. Just like JIF is a journal-level measure of quality, it
  is possible to build a journal-level measure of appliedness or commercial relevance
  by replacing paper-to-paper citationss by patent-to-paper citations.
