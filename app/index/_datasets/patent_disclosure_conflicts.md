description: 'Most scientific publishers require authors to submit their manuscripts
  with a text reporting their own parallel activities, including patent-related ones,
  that may be considered as potential Conflict-of-Interest (COI). The authors’ or
  institutional patenting activities disclosed as COI in the official version of the
  article within Conflict-of-Interest Statements (COIS) are generally analysed in
  the literature using either very focused or non-systematic approaches. This study
  proposes methods for assessing COIS presence and main features, particularly with
  respect to patent information, across biomedical topics and journals that are covered
  in the PubMed database for the period 2011-2022. However, when comparing the results
  of equivalent COI-specific searches within PubMed and a selection of journals’ websites
  for a specific topic (such as COVID-19), COIS still appears unevenly available and
  searchable in PubMed due to the practices that each publisher or preprint server
  applies across journals and over time. Thus, if COIS appear an underestimated and/or
  incompletely evaluated source of patent, the search and analysis of COI-specific
  disclosures require well-designed strategies for efficiently identifying relevant
  information and then correctly assessing technological and publishing trends or
  the effects of innovation policies.


  The data used for this project is obtained via structured searches of PubMed and
  Scholar Lens, using searches detailed in the documentation.'
