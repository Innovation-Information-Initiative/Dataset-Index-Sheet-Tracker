An interface to calculate and illustrate patent co-authorship networks and social network measures is also provided.  The network representation does not require bounding the social network beforehand.  We provide descriptive statistics of individual and collaborative vari&#13;
ables and illustrate examples of networks for an individual, an organization, a technology, and a region.  The paper provides an overview of the technical algorithms and pointers to the data, code, and documentation, with the hope of further open development by the research community.&#13;
