Missing coordinates have been imputed from equivalents and other second filings or from information on the location of applicants. The file also contains a variable indicating the source of information ('source'):&#13;
1: information comes from the first filing itself&#13;
2: information comes from direct equivalent&#13;
3: information comes from other subsequent filings&#13;
4: information comes from the applicant’s location in first filings&#13;
5: information comes from the applicant’s location in the equivalent&#13;
6: information comes from the applicant’s location in other subsequent filings;&#13;
the column 'coord_source' indicates the source of coordinates (whether they come from geolocalisation services, from geonames, or from PatentsView). &#13;
It is possible to select certain types of first filings based on column 'type'. For example, Paris Convention priority filings can be retrieved by specifying type=priority.&#13;
The file geoc_app.txt contains location information of applicants. Sources of information (first filings, equivalents, etc.) are thus browsed in reverse order.&#13;
A detailed data description can be found in de Rassenfosse, Kozak, Seliger 2019: Geocoding of worldwide patent data, published in 'Scientific Data' and available at https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-019-0264-6.&#13;
&#13;
Please note the following: &#13;
The files geoc_inv_person.txt and geoc_app_person.txt contain person IDs for inventors and applicants, respectively, whenever the location information comes from PATSTAT. If not, the person_id is = 0. These files are not described in the paper. They have been made accessible to improve interoperability with PATSTAT data.&#13;
Some files had to be zipped in order to upload them to Harvard Dataverse.</dc:description><dc:subject>Business and Management</dc:subject><dc:subject>Social Sciences</dc:subject><dc:subject>Patents</dc:subject><dc:subject>Geocoding</dc:subject><dc:subject>Location of inventors</dc:subject><dc:subject>PATSTAT</dc:subject><dc:contributor>Seliger, Florian</dc:contributor></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>
