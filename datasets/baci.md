The database is built from data directly reported by each country to the United Nations Statistical Division (Comtrade). The CEPII developed a procedure that reconciles the declarations of the exporter and the importer, that may be different in the original data. Products are defined as items from the Harmonized System nomenclature, at the 6-digit level. At a much finer disaggregation level, the nomenclature would not be similar across countries anymore.

For more information on the methodology, please read the [CEPII working paper](http://www.cepii.fr/CEPII/fr/publications/wp/abstract.asp?NoDoc=2726).
