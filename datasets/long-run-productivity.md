description: The Long-Term Productivity database was created as a project at the Bank of France in 2013 by Antonin Bergeaud, Gilbert Cette and Remy Lecat. Following the work of Cette, Mairesse and Kocoglu (2009), we extended the database to include 17 countries in the latest version (2016). The latest version of the database includes the following countries: Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Finland, France, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States. We offer data on Total Factor Productivity per hour worked, Labor productivity per hour worked, capital intensity and GDP per capita. These series cover at least the period 1890 to present annually. In addition, other data corresponding to each of the papers linked to this project are available. This includes age of capital stock, education attainment, electricity production per capita.
