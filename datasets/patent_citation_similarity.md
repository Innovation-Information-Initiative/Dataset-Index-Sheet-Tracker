description: Many studies of innovation rely on patent citations to measure intellectual
  lineage and impact. To create this dataset, we use a vector space model of patent
  similarity to compute the technological similarity between each pair of citing-cited
  patents. The VSM model analyzes the full text of each document to position it as
  a vector in a vector space that includes more than 700,000 dimensions and then calculates
  the angular distance between the two vectors. The dataset includes similarity values
  for all citations made by patents issued between 1976 and 2017 to issued patents
  or published patent applications.
