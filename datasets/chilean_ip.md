description: 'In-text and front page citations to non-patent literature and in-text
  patent citations, extracted and parsed. patCit builds on DOCDB, the largest database
  of Non Patent Literature (NPL) citations. First, we deduplicate this corpus and
  organize it into 10 categories. Then, we design and apply category specific information
  extraction models using spaCy. Eventually, when possible, we enrich the data using
  external domain specific high quality databases. Managed as an open-source, collaboratively
  maintained project. '
