description: "This database contains all patent, trademark, utility model and industrial
  design filings for Chile over the period 1991-2010.  One key contribution of the
  data construction work was to harmonize applicant names and uniquely identify applicants
  for all four forms of IP. \n\nThis database enabled the research work on the incidence
  and consequences of trademark squatting in Chile as well as on pharmaceutical patents
  in Chile, which also took place during the project’s first phase (CDIP/14/INF/3
  and CDIP/15/INF/2, respectively). Another output of the first phase project was
  the matching of the data on IP use to firm-level data of the National Statistical
  Institute (INE) – specifically, the manufacturing census (ENIA) as well as five
  waves (1997-2008) of the Chilean innovation survey (INNOVACION). These data are
  a public release from a joint WIPO-INAPI project. "
