description: "ExPORTER is a key component of the NIH \"open government\" initiatives
  to provide more transparency into NIH activities, and to improve the quality and
  usability of data collected. ExPORTER provides bulk administrative data found in
  RePORTER to the public for detailed analyses or to load into their own data systems.
  Generally, files for downloading are provided in CSV formats. The ExPORTER FAQs
  page includes the data dictionary for each file, the data refresh details, and other
  pertinent information. CRISP was the predecessor system to RePORTER, and legacy
  files drawn from this system are provided from FY 1970 to FY 2009. \n\nIn general,
  the RePORTER database of research projects is updated weekly. Each update includes
  not only the addition of newly-funded projects, but also revisions to prior awards
  (e.g., change of grantee institution or revised award amounts). There are several
  exceptions to certain portions of the database."
