description: The IPRoduct project seeks to link innovative goods to the patents upon
  which they are based. By directly linking products to patents, this project tracks
  innovation to the point where it meets consumers, the true commercial end point
  of investments in Science & Technology. The output of the project is a database
  of linked product-patent pairs that is made publicly available.
