description: 'We propose a new measure of the economic importance of each innovation.
  Our measure uses newly collected data on patents issued to US firms in the 1926
  to 2010 period, combined with the stock market response to news about patents. Our
  patent-level estimates of private economic value are positively related to the scientific
  value of these patents, as measured by the number of citations that the patent receives
  in the future. Our new measure is associated with substantial growth, reallocation
  and creative destruction, consistent with the predictions of Schumpeterian growth
  models. Aggregating our measure suggests that technological innovation accounts
  for significant medium-run fluctuations in aggregate economic growth and TFP. '
