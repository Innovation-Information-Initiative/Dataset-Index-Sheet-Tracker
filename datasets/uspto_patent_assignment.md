description: The USPTO allows parties to record assignments of patents and patent
  applications to, as much as possible, maintain a complete history of claimed interests
  in a patent. The USPTO also permits recording of other documents that affect title
  (such as certificates of name change and mergers of businesses) or are relevant
  to patent ownership (such as licensing agreements, security interests, mortgages,
  and liens). The 2020 update to the Patent Assignment Dataset contains detailed information
  on 8.97 million patent assignments and other transactions recorded at the USPTO
  since 1970 and involving roughly 15.1 million patents and patent applications. It
  is derived from the recording of patent transfers by parties with the USPTO.
