description: Innovation studies frequently distinguish between patent citation submitted
  by the patent examiner and those submitted by the patent application. However, publicly
  available citations data is often misleading, for instance by attributing a patent
  citation to the patent examiner when it was in fact first submitted by the patent
  application. This dataset uses internal USPTO data to identify the date on which
  each citation was first submitted as well as the party (examiner or applicant) who
  first submitted it. The dataset includes observations for citations made by patents
  issued 2001-2014, although some level of leftward truncation is evident due to limitations
  in internal data availability at the USPTO.
