description: 'We introduce an open-access dataset of references from the front pages
  of patents granted worldwide to scientific papers published since 1800. Each patent-paper
  linkage is assigned a confidence score, which is characterized in a random sample
  by false negatives versus false positives. All matches are available for download
  at http://relianceonscience.org. We outline several avenues for strategy research
  enabled by these new data. This contains citations from the front pages of worldwide
  patents to articles in the Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) from 1800-2020. '
