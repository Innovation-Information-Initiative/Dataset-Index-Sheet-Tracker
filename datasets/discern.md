description: 'Patents (as well as scientific articles, and NPL citations at the aggregate
  firm-level) matched to U.S. Compustat firms over the period 1980-2015. In extending
  the match to Compustat up to 2015, we address two major challenges: name changes
  and ownership changes. Our UO and subsidiary historical standardized firm name lists,
  including the dynamic reassignment, are publicly available for researches to match
  to their database of interest.


  As of 2023, DISCERN has been enriched to extend additional years, broader coverage
  of subsidiary data, and to add open-access matches to scientific publications. More
  information about the updates may be found in the following NBER whitepaper: https://conference.nber.org/conf_papers/f193007.pdf'
