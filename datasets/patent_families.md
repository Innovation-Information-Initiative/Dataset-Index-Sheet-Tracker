description: Patent applicants frequently file groups of patent applications linked
  together by priority claims. These priority claims create families of patent applications
  that share features such as inventors, priority dates, and technical descriptions.
  By analyzing these linkages, each patent can be assigned a family identifier that
  it shares with other patents in the same family. This data set includes two levels
  of family identifiers (clone for near copies, and extended for more attenuated linkages)
  for each patent issued 2005-2014
