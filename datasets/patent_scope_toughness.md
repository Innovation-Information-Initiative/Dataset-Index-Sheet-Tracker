description: This dataset includes an easy-to-use measure of patent scope that is
  grounded both in patent law and in the practices of patent attorneys. Our measure
  counts the number of words in the patents’ first claim. The longer the first claim,
  the less scope a patent has. This is because a longer claim has more details – and
  all those details must be met for another invention to be infringing. Hence, the
  more details there are in the patent, the greater are the opportunities for others
  to invent around it. We validate our measure by showing both that patent attorneys’
  subjective assessments of scope agree with our estimates, and that the behavior
  of patenters is consistent with it. To facilitate drawing causal inferences with
  our measure, we show how it can be used to create an instrumental variable, patent
  examiner Scope Toughness, which we also validate.
