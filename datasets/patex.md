description: The latest version of PatEx (referred to below as the 2020 release) contains
  detailed information on nearly 11.9 million publicly-viewable provisional and non-provisional
  patent applications to the USPTO and over 4.6 million Patent Cooperation Treaty
  (PCT) applications. It is based on data that OCE downloaded from the Patent Examination
  Data System (PEDS) in April, 2021. The PEDS data are sourced from Public PAIR. The
  first time that OCE used PEDS as the basis of PatEx was for the 2019 release. We
  took the PEDS data and organized it into the familiar PatEx data files, which are
  based on the organization of the Public PAIR portal. The data files include information
  on each application’s characteristics, prosecution history, continuation history,
  claims of foreign priority, patent term adjustment history, publication history,
  and correspondence address information.
